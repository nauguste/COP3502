/*This program demonstrates a simple example of file I/O 
and storing the data from the file into a structure.
It reads a text file with 5 students' id numbers and their scores for 3 courses.
The program reads those scores and output the same information and average
score into another text file. Then it finds and writes the maximum average and 
the student who obtained the max average to the new text file
